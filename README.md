# 🚢 Battleship Game in Java

A console-based Battleship game built in Java.
Developed as part of my Hyperskill learning path, this project explores arrays, loops, conditional logic, and user input validation while implementing the classic game of Battleship.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The project progresses through multiple stages, each adding new functionality:

- **Game Board Setup** – Implemented a 10x10 grid for placing ships.
- **Ship Placement** - Allowed players to position ships horizontally or vertically with adjacency rules.
- **Fog of War** – Displayed a masked version of the opponent’s board during the game.
- **Gameplay Loop** – Alternating turns between two players, each taking shots at the grid.
- **Hit Detection** – Checked whether a shot was a hit, miss, or sank a ship.
- **Win Condition** – Declared the winner when all enemy ships were destroyed.

## 🎯 What I Learned

- 📊 **2D Arrays**: Managed the game grid and ship positions with multidimensional arrays.
- 📐 **Algorithmic Problem-Solving**: Designed logic for ship placement, adjacency validation, and shooting mechanics.
- 🔄 **Loops & Conditionals**: Created the main game loop with multiple layers of checks.
- 🧑‍💻 **User Input Validation**: Ensured players entered valid coordinates and ship placements.
- 🧩 **Modular Code Design**: Separated logic into methods for better readability and maintainability.

## 🔧 Features
- ✅ Two-player turn-based Battleship gameplay.
- ✅ Ship placement with validation (no overlapping, no adjacency).
- ✅ Fog of war mechanic to hide enemy ships.
- ✅ Hit, miss, and sunk ship detection.
- ✅ Victory condition once all ships are sunk.
- ✅ Clean and interactive CLI experience.

## 🤔 How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Battleships-with-Java.git
2. Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Compile and run Main.java.
4. Follow the prompts to set code length and symbol range, then start guessing!

## 📈 Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, I:

Strengthened my understanding of arrays and grid-based programming.

Practiced implementing validation rules and handling complex user input.

Gained experience in designing a modular turn-based game loop.

Learned how to simulate a real-world game with CLI interactions.
